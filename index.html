    <p>Hi! Glad you are here. We offer training services to help you and your horse have a healthy and safe
      relationship, both on the ground and in the saddle. We primarily focus on giving safe and positive starts to young
      horses, including ensuring they have respect and good manners on the ground. We will also work with you if you
      have any specific behavioral concerns that you need assistance with.</p>
    <p>Our typical training fee is $1000/month including board at our farm during your horse's training. If you are
      within a
      reasonable driving distance of Seymour, Missouri and would prefer we come to you, please reach out and we can come
      up with alternative pricing.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the things your horse may experience during their time with us:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Leading manners lessons</li>
      <li>Learning to isolate and maneuver their front and hind quarters when asked</li>
      <li>Standing tied for grooming, handling feet, fly spraying, etc.</li>
      <li>Round penning, lunging, and/or long lining</li>
      <li>Started under saddle</li>
      <li>Ridden both on and off property to gain exposure to a variety of environments and learn to handle stressful or
        scary situations</li>
      <li>Learning to respond to riding aids appropriately, including the basics of lateral movement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a> anytime, and we will respond to your questions or concerns
      as soon as possible! We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
