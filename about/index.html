    <p>Clark has spent most of his life caring for, training, and spending time with horses. From a young age, he
      worked with every horse he came in contact with using kindness, patience, understanding, and skill. In an effort
      to improve upon his foundational knowledge, after high school he attended William Woods University's equestrian
      program, graduating in 2009 with a B.S. in Equestrian Science. Clark most enjoys giving young horses a solid start
      so they will have the opportunity to enjoy good lives with the people they come into contact with.</p>
