      <p>Clark has spent most of his life caring for, training, and spending time with horses. From a young age, he
        worked with every horse he came in contact with using kindness, patience, understanding, and skill. In an effort
        to improve upon his foundational knowledge, after high school he attended William Woods University's equestrian
        program, graduating in 2009 with a B.S. in Equestrian Science. Clark most enjoys giving young horses a solid
        start
        so they will have the opportunity to enjoy good lives with the people they come into contact with.</p>
